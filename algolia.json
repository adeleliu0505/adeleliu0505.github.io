I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I\u0026amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won\u0026amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.\nWe\u0026amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we\u0026amp;rsquo;ll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites.\nIn this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the \u0026amp;ldquo;$\u0026amp;rdquo; prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with \u0026amp;ldquo;#\u0026amp;rdquo; are comments that I\u0026amp;rsquo;ve added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the \u0026amp;ldquo;:wq\u0026amp;rdquo; on the last line means to save the file.\nHere\u0026amp;rsquo;s an example:\n## this is a comment $ echo this is a command this is a command ## edit the file $ vi foo.md +++ date = \u0026amp;#34;2014-09-28\u0026amp;#34; title = \u0026amp;#34;creating a new theme\u0026amp;#34; +++ bah and humbug :wq ## show it $ cat foo.md +++ date = \u0026amp;#34;2014-09-28\u0026amp;#34; title = \u0026amp;#34;creating a new theme\u0026amp;#34; +++ bah and humbug $ Some Definitions There are a few concepts that you need to understand before creating a theme.\nSkins Skins are the files responsible for the look and feel of your site. It’s the CSS that controls colors and fonts, it’s the Javascript that determines actions and reactions. It’s also the rules that Hugo uses to transform your content into the HTML that the site will serve to visitors.\nYou have two ways to create a skin. The simplest way is to create it in the layouts/ directory. If you do, then you don’t have to worry about configuring Hugo to recognize it. The first place that Hugo will look for rules and files is in the layouts/ directory so it will always find the skin.\nYour second choice is to create it in a sub-directory of the themes/ directory. If you do, then you must always tell Hugo …","date":1411862400,"description":"","lastmod":"2014-09-28T00:00:00Z","objectID":"a3e7063a0e9e0c1d8d6ccd47a4b57e30","permalink":"https://adeleliu0505.github.io/post/creating-a-new-theme/","publishdate":"2014-09-28T00:00:00Z","title":"Creating a New Theme"},{"categories":["Development","golang"],"content":"Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.\nThis document is a brief primer on using Go templates. The Go docs provide more details.\nIntroduction to Go Templates Go templates provide an extremely simple template language. It adheres to the belief that only the most basic of logic belongs in the template or view layer. One consequence of this simplicity is that Go templates parse very quickly.\nA unique characteristic of Go templates is they are content aware. Variables and content will be sanitized depending on the context of where they are used. More details can be found in the Go docs.\nBasic Syntax Golang templates are HTML files with the addition of variables and functions.\nGo variables and functions are accessible within {{ }}\nAccessing a predefined variable \u0026amp;ldquo;foo\u0026amp;rdquo;:\n{{ foo }} Parameters are separated using spaces\nCalling the add function with input of 1, 2:\n{{ add 1 2 }} Methods and fields are accessed via dot notation\nAccessing the Page Parameter \u0026amp;ldquo;bar\u0026amp;rdquo;\n{{ .Params.bar }} Parentheses can be used to group items together\n{{ if or (isset .Params \u0026amp;quot;alt\u0026amp;quot;) (isset .Params \u0026amp;quot;caption\u0026amp;quot;) }} Caption {{ end }} Variables Each Go template has a struct (object) made available to it. In hugo each template is passed either a page or a node struct depending on which type of page you are rendering. More details are available on the variables page.\nA variable is accessed by referencing the variable name.\n\u0026amp;lt;title\u0026amp;gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026amp;lt;/title\u0026amp;gt; Variables can also be defined and referenced.\n{{ $address := \u0026amp;quot;123 Main St.\u0026amp;quot;}} {{ $address }} Functions Go template ship with a few functions which …","date":1396396800,"description":"","lastmod":"2014-04-02T00:00:00Z","objectID":"4f1f56186d2fece779068cd43c2d5eb2","permalink":"https://adeleliu0505.github.io/post/goisforlovers/","publishdate":"2014-04-02T00:00:00Z","tags":["go","golang","templates","themes","development"],"title":"(Hu)go Template Primer"},{"categories":["Development","golang"],"content":"Step 1.

Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there.

Hugo supports parameters custom configuration too. Refer to the Hugo configuration documentation for details.\nSet your configuration publish folder to _site The default is for Jekyll to publish to _site and for Hugo to publish to public. If, like me, you have _site mapped to a git submodule on the gh-pages branch, you\u0026amp;rsquo;ll want to do one of two alternatives:\nChange your submodule to point to map gh-pages to public instead of _site (recommended).\ngit submodule deinit _site git rm _site git submodule add -b gh-pages git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git public Or, change the Hugo configuration to use _site instead of public.\n{ .. \u0026amp;quot;publishdir\u0026amp;quot;: \u0026amp;quot;_site\u0026amp;quot;, .. } Convert Jekyll templates to Hugo templates That\u0026amp;rsquo;s the bulk of the work right here.
